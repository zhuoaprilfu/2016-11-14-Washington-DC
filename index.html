  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation.  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.

  SYLLABUS

Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
For this workshop, the Federal Reserve Board IT staff have installed the 
necessary software onto the training room computers. If you do not have these 
programs on your work computer, please contact IT directly. If you would like 
to follow-up on the workshop lessons at home, you will need working copies of 
R, RStudio, Firefox Browser, the SQLite plug-in for Firefox, and OpenRefine. 

<p>
To install these programs on a personal computer (not owned by the Federal 
Reserve Board), please follow these <a href=install.html>Setup Instructions</a>.

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
